Mobile App Grant HTML File

Project Description: Mobile App Grant HTML File
This project provides a simple HTML file hosted on GitHub Pages, acting as a toggle or grant mechanism for a mobile app developed using Kodular. The HTML file contains a single word: "True," which serves as a signal for the app to determine whether it is allowed to function or not.

Purpose:
The purpose of this HTML page is to act as a control point for the app's operation. The app will perform an HTTP GET request to this specific URL, and based on the content retrieved ("True" or "False"), the app will either enable or disable certain functionalities or access permissions.

How It Works:

The HTML file is hosted via GitHub Pages and can be accessed via a specific URL.
The mobile app, built using Kodular, sends an HTTP GET request to this URL.
If the content of the response is "True," the app continues its normal operations.
If the content is anything other than "True," the app may restrict access or functionality, acting as a simple control mechanism.
This setup can be useful for scenarios where remote toggling of app functionality is required without needing to release a new version of the app.

Use Cases:

Temporarily disabling an app's functionality during maintenance or updates.
Enforcing certain conditions before allowing the app to proceed with its operations.
Controlling access to features based on remote conditions.
